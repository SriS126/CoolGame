# the Game Plannnnn 

## Overview
I wanna build a educational game that teaches the basics of entrepreneurship through decision makingg and real world questions

My plan is to make an RPG game where you walk around with NPCs, interact with them, and they give you quiz questions, while making it all into a cool story game

## tech stack  
i’m using JavaScript because it’s the perfect language for building interactive web games. 

im thinking about using Phaser.js to handle the RPG mechanics and the world-building. 

for the graphics, I’m using p5.js, and Howler.js will give us all the sound goodness. I’ll probably go with Vue.js or React.js for the UI to keep it smooth.

## game flow  
First up, you choose your character and the difficulty level.  

Then, you’ll walk around the world, meetingg NPCs who are ready to throw some business challenges your way.  

Answer quiz questions and make decisions that affect your business journey and the story. The better the decisions, the further you’ll go and maybe get more of a currency thing

The end game will probably bee that your business will get set up or fail (rip)

## design  
Visuals will be simple but clean RPG style, like immersive environments, easy to  navigate maps, and NPCs that give off major entrepreneurial vibes.  

The music will be chill, background stuff nothing too crazy, but enough to keep you in the zone while making decisions. sound effects will highlight interactions, like answering quiz questions or making big business moves.


## future ideas  
Maybe dive deeper into advanced entrepreneurship topics to keep things fresh

Maybe even add multiplayer mode somehow or do like one player plays with WASD, another with arrow keys, and theyll race to get as much money or somethn
